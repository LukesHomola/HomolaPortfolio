              HELLO

Welcome to my web portfolio repository.

- My name is Lukáš and I'm a 20 years old guy from Czech Republic with interests in technologies.

- I wanted to make my own unique design instead of using templates.

- Disclaimer, I know it's not the best, but I've done it on my own. At the end, there's no better way to imporove yourself then learning by practice.
  - During the procees I've got some issues and learned new concepts on the way but for now, I feel like this portfolio is good for me. Maybe, gonna rework it later on with some more practice and better pov with more advanced experience.
